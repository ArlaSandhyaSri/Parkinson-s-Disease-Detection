Parkinson's Disease Detection Using Machine Learning (SVM Algorithm) - 89% Accuracy

Developed a machine learning model using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm to detect Parkinson's disease from medical datasets. 
The model was trained on various vocal and movement features of patients, identifying patterns indicative of the disease. 
Achieved an accuracy of 89%, demonstrating the model's potential for early detection and aiding in timely medical intervention.
The project involved data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, and performance evaluation using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.
